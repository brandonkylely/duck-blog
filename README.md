  ## Description

  rubber duck debugging is the very real practice of debugging by explaining your code to a nonsentient object, such as a rubber duck. these rubber ducks sit through hours of your rambling, unmoving and stoic in their guidance. however, what if these ducks were actual people? in ```duck blog```, users, who shall now be known as ducks, are free to express their thoughts about programming, however advanced or silly their questions may be. other ducks are free to critique your questions in a manner that nonsentient beings never could.
  
  Duck Blog is intended to be a satirical tech blog.
